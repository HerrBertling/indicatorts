### Volume Strategies

Momentum strategies generate signals based on a momentum indicator.

- [Force Index Strategy](#force-index-strategy)
- [Money Flow Index Strategy](#money-flow-index-strategy)

#### Force Index Strategy

The [forceIndexStrategy](./forceIndexStrategy.ts) uses the _fi_ values that are generated by the [Force Index (FI)](../../indicator/volume/index.md#force-index-fi) indicator function to provide a _BUY_ action when _fi_ is greather than zero, and a _SELL_ action when _fi_ is less than zero, a _HOLD_ action otherwise.

```TypeScript
import {forceIndexStrategy} from 'indicatorts';

const actions = forceIndexStrategy(asset);
```

#### Money Flow Index Strategy

The [moneyFlowIndexStrategy](./moneyFlowIndexStrategy.ts) uses the _mfi_ values that are generated by the [Money Flow Index (MFI)](../../indicator/volume/index.md#money-flow-index-mfi) indicator function to provide a _SELL_ action when _mfi_ is greather than or equal to 80, and a _BUY_ action when _mfi_ is less than or equal to 20.

```TypeScript
import {moneyFlowIndexStrategy} from 'indicatorts';

const actions = moneyFlowIndexStrategy(asset);
```
